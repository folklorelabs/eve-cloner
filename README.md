## EVE Settings Cloner

Clone your EVE settings across accounts and characters. This tool is a script that executes the old ["manually copy and paste your files" strategy](https://forums.eveonline.com/t/manually-copy-settings-between-characters-and-accounts/32704).


### Running the app

Running the app will open a terminal and walk you through each step. The script will always back up your setting files and print out the backup location in case you need to revert.
